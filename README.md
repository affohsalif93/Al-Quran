## Goal
This project aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible Quran application that can be used on desktop devices. It is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, allowing users to read, search, take notes and interact with the Quran seamlessly.

## Important Notice
This project started and remains (at least for now) a personal project i.e. a tool am building for myself first. This means I will give priority to features I need for myself and might reject some features that don't fit with the immediate goal of the app. 

## Inspiration and Credits
- It's strongly inspired by [Quran Windows App](https://quransoft.net/en).
- Credits to [aymendn](https://github.com/aymendn/quran-app) for the initial boilerplate and structure of the application.
